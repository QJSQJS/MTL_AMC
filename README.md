Multitask Learning  Modulation Classification

This project is the code for our paper "Blind Modulation Classification Under Uncertain Noise Conditions: A Multitask Learning Approach".

# Version
tensorflow>=1.12.0

Keras>=2.2.4



# Dataset

The download links for the datasets "rice_x_h_1024_alldb_1000" and "rice_x_h_n_1024_alldb_1000" mentioned in the paper are as follows: [rice_x_h_1024_alldb_1000](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QZjZL19iQW2MFHE52aLfnQ?pwd=vhup).

Among them, rice_x_h_n_1024_alldb_1000.pkl contains noisy data, and rice_x_h_1024_alldb_1000.pkl is the corresponding noise-free data.
